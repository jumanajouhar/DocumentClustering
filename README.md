# A Comparison of K-Means and K-Medoids Algorithms in Document Clustering 

This notebook explored the application of K-Means and 
K-Medoids clustering algorithms for grouping BBC news articles based on textual content. Using 
TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction 
techniques like PCA and t-SNE, the work provided visual and quantitative 
insights into the clustering performance. The evaluation metrics indicated 
that K-Means outperformed K-Medoids in terms of Adjusted Rand Index and 
Normalized Mutual Information, while K-Medoids had a marginally better F1 
score. This showcases the importance of choosing the right clustering 
technique based on the nature and structure of the data.
